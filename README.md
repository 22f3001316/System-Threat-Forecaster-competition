# System-Threat-Forecaster-competition
The goal of this competition is to predict a system’s probability of getting infected by various families of malware, based on different properties of that system. The telemetry data containing these properties and the system infections was generated by threat reports collected by system's antivirus software.
# Malware Detection - MLP Project T12025

This is a Machine Learning project submitted for the **IITM BS Degree Program (T12025)**. The task is to predict whether a system is infected by malware based on telemetry data from antivirus reports.

## 📁 Project Structure

- `21f1001234-notebook-t12025.ipynb` - Final notebook used in the competition
- `submission.csv` - Final predictions in the required format
- `train.csv`, `test.csv`, `sample_submission.csv` - Provided datasets

## 🧠 Problem Statement

Predict a system’s probability of getting infected by various families of malware, based on machine-specific features and telemetry data. The dataset contains ~150 system attributes like:

- Product and OS version info
- Device hardware features (RAM, processor, display)
- Security configuration (Firewall, Secure Boot, TPM, etc.)

## 📊 Dataset

Files:
- `train.csv` – With target labels (0/1)
- `test.csv` – Without target, for submission
- `sample_submission.csv` – Sample output format

Target column:
- `target` (0 = No Malware, 1 = Malware Detected)

Each row represents a unique machine identified by `MachineID`.

## 🛠️ Libraries Used

- `NumPy`
- `Pandas`
- `Matplotlib`
- `Seaborn`
- `scikit-learn`
- `XGBoost`
- `LightGBM`
- `Imblearn` (for handling class imbalance)

## ⚙️ ML Pipeline

1. **Data Cleaning** – Removed/Imputed nulls, encoded categorical features.
2. **EDA** – Explored class distribution, correlations.
3. **Feature Engineering** – Label encoding, scaling, etc.
4. **Modeling** – Tried XGBoost, LightGBM, RandomForest.
5. **Evaluation** – Used `accuracy_score` as required.
6. **Submission** – Saved predictions in the required `id` and `target` format.

## ✅ Results

Achieved an accuracy of **XX%** on test set (can mention if known).
